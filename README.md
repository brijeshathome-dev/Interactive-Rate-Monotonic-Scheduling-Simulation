# 🕒 Interactive Rate Monotonic Scheduling Simulation

An **interactive web-based simulator** for **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)** — a preemptive real-time CPU scheduling algorithm.  
This tool allows users to visualize how periodic tasks are scheduled based on their priorities, determined by their periods.  
It runs directly in your web browser through the file **`rms.html`**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧮 Simulates **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)** in real time  
- 💡 Allows users to input custom task parameters (Execution Time, Period, Deadline, etc.)  
- 📊 Displays task execution order using a **Gantt chart visualization**  
- ⚙️ Performs **schedulability checks** based on RMS utilization formula  
- 🌐 Works directly in any browser — no installation required
